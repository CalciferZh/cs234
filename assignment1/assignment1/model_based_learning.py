  """Build a model of the environment and use value iteration to learn a policy. In the next episode, play with the new 
    policy using epsilon-greedy exploration. 

    Your model of the environment should be based on updating counts and rewards arrays. The counts array counts the number
    of times that "state" with "action" led to "next_state", and the rewards array is the running average of rewards for 
    going from at "state" with "action" leading to "next_state". 

    For a single episode, create a list called "history" with all the experience
    from that episode, then update the "counts" and "rewards" arrays using the function "update_mdp_model_with_history". 

    You may then call the prewritten function "counts_and_rewards_to_P" to convert your counts and rewards arrays to 
    an environment data structure P consistent with the Gym environment's one. You may then call on value_iteration(P, nS, nA) 
    to get a policy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    env: gym.core.Environment
      Environment to compute Q function for. Must have nS, nA, and P as
      attributes.
    num_episodes: int

    gamma: float
      Discount factor. Number in range [0, 1)
    learning_rate: float
      Learning rate. Number in range [0, 1)
    e: float
      Epsilon value used in the epsilon-greedy method. 
    decay_rate: float
      Rate at which epsilon falls. Number in range [0, 1)
